# CodeFunDo

We are planning to build a locality-based regression model to predict the severity of the earthquake. 
- We are using ANSS Composite Catalog dataset from NCEDC (2016), Northern California Earthquake Data Center. UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory.
- We are planning to use clustering algorithm to get the localities and kernel based linear regression to solve the problem.
- We will be using Python3 to code.
